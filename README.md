# Active Server

I am hosting the Node.js backend code for multiple projects here under one respository due to the usage limitations of the free tier of Cyclic.com, where this server is hosted. 

The front end code for the HP Store Notepad project can be found [HERE](https://github.com/misterplain/hpNotePad) and the deployed site can be found [HERE](https://hpnotepad.onrender.com/)

The front end code for my portfolio can be found [HERE](https://github.com/misterplain/portfolioV2) and the deployed site can be found [HERE](https://patrickobrien.onrender.com/)

The front end code for the Fantastic Snowboards project can be found [HERE](https://github.com/misterplain/fantasticfy) and the deployed site can be found [HERE](https://fantasticfy.onrender.com/)

Any and all feedback on this project is welcome, you may contact me [HERE](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-o-brien-6743b044/)!
